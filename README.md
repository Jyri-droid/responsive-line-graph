# responsive-line-graph
An adaptive and visually responsive line graph. Any amount of data points between any range can be fed into the graph. An automatic data range prettifier is a work in progress as well.

Things that could be fixed:
* I wasn't so good at JS when I created this one, the JS probably could be simplified
* The end of the low range and start of first datapoint don't always match
* When the data range prettifier is ready, it should be connected to the graph
